### 🚀 What I’m about
- 🧠 **AI + Practical Software** — I like shipping small, useful AI tools: voice agents, resume analyzers, and e-commerce apps.  
- 🛠️ **Builder Mindset** — I founded and scaled **Scenthut**, an e-commerce fragrance brand, from scratch.  
- 🎯 **Internship Goal (2025)** — Software Engineering Intern where I can own features end-to-end, talk to users, and ship.

  - 💰 Scaled to **$8–10K monthly revenue** within 12 months  
  - 📈 Grew Instagram/TikTok community to **18K followers** through consistent content  
  - 📦 Managed logistics, customer retention, and marketing while studying full-time
